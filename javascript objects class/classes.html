        // ✅ 1. Basic Class Definition
class Vehicle {
  // The constructor method runs when a new object is created from this class
  constructor() {
    this.wheels = 4; // Default number of wheels for a vehicle
  }

  // A method that all Vehicle instances can use
  describe() {
    console.log(`This vehicle has ${this.wheels} wheels.`);
  }
}

// ✅ 2. Creating an object from the class
const myVehicle = new Vehicle();
myVehicle.describe(); // Output: This vehicle has 4 wheels





// ✅ 3. Class with a constructor that takes parameters
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name; // The name is set when the object is created
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

const cat = new Animal("Whiskers");
cat.speak(); // Output: Whiskers makes a sound.



// ✅ 4. Inheritance using 'extends'
class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(brand) {
    super(); // Calls the parent (Vehicle) constructor to set wheels = 4
    this.brand = brand; // Child class adds new property
  }

  info() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} car has ${this.wheels} wheels.`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Toyota");
myCar.describe(); // Output: This vehicle has 4 wheels
myCar.info();     // Output: Toyota car has 4 wheels



// ✅ 5. Passing external values into classes (advanced understanding)
const externalWheels = 6;

class Truck extends Vehicle {
  constructor(wheels) {
    super(); // You could also do: super(wheels) if Vehicle accepted parameters
    this.wheels = wheels; // Overriding parent property with new value
  }

  load() {
    console.log(`This truck with ${this.wheels} wheels is ready to load.`);
  }
}

const toyotaTruck = new Truck(externalWheels);
toyotaTruck.describe(); // Output: This vehicle has 6 wheels
toyotaTruck.load();     // Output: This truck with 6 wheels is ready to load




// ✅ 6. Summary of Key Points (in comments)

/*
1. Classes are templates for creating objects.
2. The constructor() is used to initialize object properties.
3. Use 'this' to refer to the current object’s properties.
4. Use 'extends' to create a subclass (child) that inherits from a parent class.
5. 'super()' must be called in the child constructor to access the parent's constructor.
6. Child classes can add their own properties and methods.
7. Data must be passed manually unless the parent sets defaults internally.
