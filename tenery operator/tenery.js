//tenery operator = a short cut to if else statements 
//the code below is a simple example of how to use the tenery operator


let grade = score < 40 ? "Fail" :
            score < 60 ? "Pass" :
            score < 75 ? "Good" :
            score < 90 ? "Very Good" :
            "Excellent";
//the code above is equivalent to the following if else statements
//its called a nested tenery operator
